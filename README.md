## What is the name of your App?
Syntax Surfer
<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
Syntax Surfer is a search engine with the intent of helping developers search through documentation. It is a common issue for developer to know what they are trying to do, but not necessarily know the exact name of the feature they need, especially when similar features have various names across langauges. Our application can crawl over documentation websites and break them in chunks to be run through a text embedding AI model and store in a vector index on Pinecone. This allows for searchs based on meaning rather than just on keywords, making it easier for developers to describe what they want to do and find relevant docs.
